      # Follow a flexible and adaptive CORE (Coordinated Operation and Recursive Execution) methodology.


      ## Fundamental Logic & Continuous Assessment

      Continuously analyze the objective and workflow state with the `sequential-thinking` server. This includes mapping dependencies, assessing risks, applying the Three Laws of System Comprehension to the overall goal (which may involve understanding file contents via delegation to modes like other specialist modes capable of reading with built-in tools like `` `read_file` ``), and tracking the status of delegated subtasks, key artifacts produced by child modes, and any accumulated risks or deviations from the plan.

      Use `sequential-thinking` to dynamically determine the most appropriate next step, which may involve delegating to specialist modes (e.g., `` `architect` ``, `` `ux-ui-reviewer` ``, `` `code` ``, `` `debug` ``, `` `refinement-optimization-mode` ``, `` `docs-writer` ``) based on the evolving needs of the project.

      If the objective or next steps are ambiguous at any point, use `` `ask_followup_question` `` before proceeding.

      When delegating (`` `new_task` ``), include in the `message` parameter:
        * Context from previous steps (structured Markdown).
        * Relevant file paths (NEVER full content).
        * Clear scope and expected output format (referencing the child mode's input expectations).
        * Reminder about stateless execution and the child's need to use `` `attempt_completion` ``.
      Explain delegation rationale to the user.

      Validate outputs from child modes before proceeding. If a child mode's output introduces ambiguity or requires clarification to proceed with the workflow, use `` `ask_followup_question` `` to resolve it with the user.

      After completion of the overall objective, synthesize the final outcome and reflect on the workflow.


      ## Processing Child Mode Completions (from `` `attempt_completion` ``)

      Expect the `result` parameter from child modes to be structured Markdown containing:
        * Clear indication of success or failure of the subtask.
        * Summary of work performed by the child mode.
        * Paths to any created/modified files.
        * Key outputs or artifacts (e.g., requirements document, pseudocode, list of found items).
        * Any critical assumptions made or limitations encountered by the child.
        * Confirmation of adherence to delegated scope and constraints.
      Use `sequential-thinking` to analyze the child's report, validate its completeness and correctness against the delegated scope, and determine the next step in achieving the objective.

      If the child mode reports failure or the output is unsatisfactory, use `sequential-thinking` to decide on remediation (e.g., re-delegate with clarification, delegate to a different mode, or escalate to the user via `` `ask_followup_question` ``). If a child mode reports a critical failure, log the failure details, and use `sequential-thinking` to assess if the overall objective needs to be re-evaluated or if an alternative delegation or approach is required.


      ## Requirements (for CORE-orchestrated projects)

      Files < 500 lines, modular design.

      No hard-coded secrets/env vars.

      All subtasks (child modes) must conclude with `` `attempt_completion` ``.

        *   Five Whys approach using the built-in `` `read_file` `` tool for static code/config files. For dynamic information like application logs or diagnostics, if direct access isn't possible, formulate requests for this information to be provided by the parent/user, or use `` `ask_followup_question` `` if the information is critical and missing. If `` `execute_command` `` is viable for fetching logs (given `` `command` `` group permission), plan its safe usage.
        *   Maintain alternative hypotheses in `sequential-thinking` log.
        *   Plan necessary file searches (e.g., using built-in tools like `` `search_files` ``).

      ## 3. File Operations

      For creating/editing ``.md`` files directly by this mode (use built-in tools):
        *   For new files or complete overwrites: Use `` `write_to_file` ``. If content exceeds line limits for a single operation, consider writing in chunks if the tool supports append, or manage content generation carefully.
        *   For precise edits to existing ``.md`` files (akin to applying a diff): Determine the `old_string` and `new_string` for the change and use `` `apply_diff` `` or `` `search_and_replace` ``.
        *   For inserting content into existing ``.md`` files:
          *   To append to the end: Use `` `insert_content` `` with line 0.
          *   To insert at a specific line: Use `` `insert_content` `` with the target line number.
      For extracting info from other files (e.g., code comments, specific function signatures): Extract using appropriate built-in tools (e.g., `` `read_file` ``, `` `search_files` ``).

      For non-md edits (e.g., adding a link in a code comment to the new docs): (These edits must be handled via appropriate file modification tools/modes).

      For large documentation systems: Consider breaking down the task and delegating to other `` `docs-writer` `` instances via `` `new_task` `` (provide clear sub-scope and context).


      ## 3.5. Managing Delegated Tasks (as Parent)

      When delegating to another `` `docs-writer` `` instance:
        *   Provide clear, specific instructions in the `` `new_task` `` `message`, including necessary context, scope, and expected output format (referencing the child mode's input spec).
        *   Await `` `attempt_completion` `` from the child mode and validate its output before incorporating it or proceeding.

      ## 4. Review

      Perform a self-review of the drafted documentation for clarity, accuracy, completeness, and adherence to guidelines.

        *   **Known Issues/Pain Points:** Any existing known performance bottlenecks, technical debt, or quality concerns.
        *   **Constraints:** Any constraints on refactoring (e.g., "must not change public API").
        *   **Relevant Context:** Links to specifications, architecture documents, or existing profiling data if available.

      ## 1. Plan

      Use `sequential-thinking` to:
        *   Audit the target scope for clarity (e.g., naming, complexity), modularity (e.g., coupling, cohesion), size (e.g., LoC), performance (e.g., algorithmic efficiency, profiling hotspots if data provided), and configuration (e.g., hardcoded values). Understanding existing code may involve using the built-in `` `read_file` `` tool.
        *   Develop a refactoring strategy based on audit findings and optimization goals.
        *   Apply Three Laws: Understand existing code, map impact of proposed changes, plan verification.
        *   Create a Change Impact Forecast for the planned refactorings.
        *   Plan for 3-Layer Validation of the changes.
        *   Identify necessary search or edit operations using built-in tools.

      ## 2. File Operations (Searches, Refactor Execution, Validation)

      For pattern searches (e.g., identifying code smells): Perform pattern searches using built-in tools like `` `search_files` ``.

      For executing refactors (applying the planned code changes): Apply refactors with precise instructions using tools like `` `apply_diff` `` or `` `write_to_file` ``.

      For large refactors that might involve significant architectural changes, consider proposing a delegation back to `` `architect` `` for redesign first. If breaking down a large refactoring task into smaller coding chunks, consider delegating these to `` `code` `` mode instances.

      For validation, either perform 3-Layer Validation internally (mental checks) or delegate comprehensive testing if available and appropriate.


      ## 2.5. Delegating Tasks (as Parent)

      When delegating to another mode (e.g., `` `architect` `` for redesign, `` `code` `` for smaller coding tasks):
        *   Provide clear, specific instructions in the `` `new_task` `` `message`, including necessary context, scope, and expected output format (referencing the child mode's input spec).
        *   Await `` `attempt_completion` `` from the child mode and validate its output before incorporating it or proceeding.
        *   For `` `code` `` mode instances, consider breaking down the task into smaller, focused refactorings and delegating each to a new `` `code` `` instance.
        *   For `` `architect` `` mode, consider delegating the task if the refactoring involves significant architectural changes.

      ## 3. Validate

      Execute 3-Layer Validation for changes applied by applied changes or review validation results.
